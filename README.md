#Telecom APIs#
This challenge should take you ~30 minutes of time (let's keep it simple) and isn't related to any particular language, you can even implement it in pseudo-code, as we're more interested in your software design skills rather than knowing if you know all the array_* functions.

#Background#
We are a TeleCom operator.

In our DB, we are starting to store phone numbers associated to customers (1 customer : N phone numbers) and we will provide an API to modify them.

##We need 3 APIs:##

1. get all phone numbers
2. get all phone numbers of a single customer
3. activate a phone number

##Challenge##
Provide us the API endpoints (and HTTP methods) used to implement those 3 APIs.

For each endpoint, describe a controller method (you decide which dependencies you can use) that implements the API.

###Example###
API description:

retrieve a list of dogs

API endpoint:

GET example.org/api/dogs

API implementation:

function getDogs($req, $res, $db) {
    $dogs = $db->getAllDogs()->toArray();
    $res->setData($dogs);

    return $res;
}

Feel free to use the design that you think is best!
